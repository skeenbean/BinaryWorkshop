## Introduction
Bad seed vulnerabilities occur when a Random Number Generator (otherwise known as RNG) that is being used by an OS gets seeded with a value that isn't randomized in an optimal way. This can occur due to predictable seed values, flawed seed mechanisms, etc. Thi can come off as a problem due to the vulnerability towards Session Hijacking, exposure to certain attacks, and many more cases and situations. An example of a bad seed vulnerability is when a Debian developer removed a seeding mechanism in order to fix a memory debugging issue. This caused an impact in the randomness of generated keys. This meant that all material generated using OpenSSLwas compromised. This matters because when hen the seed is predictable, that makes valuable information and materials lost their security.

## Approach
The time program is usedto measure the duration of time taken to be executed. during our time in Ghidra, we were shown what it looked like when the time program was ran. The time program in other words, presents itself as the amount of time that has elapsed in seconds since the EPOCH. The EPOCH is the perceived time period in which the internet was created, which falls around a time in the 1970s. Out solution will include the uses of time, rand and srand.
